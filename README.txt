I'm finding it really difficult to implement the checkTags using stack.
I didn't know how to run the code so i had to look up how to compile java code.
I tried writing the code the same way you would write a balanced bracket code, but it didn't work, it was too much work.
I got help from a peer who helped me think through it.
I realised it would be better to create a helper method for when it is matching and call it checkTags, but 
when i tried there were a lot more errors in my code so I didn't make it a helper method.
